# maze_project
final year project for the alx project
This is a simple modern 3d maze game for my final year in alx program. 
It's a very simple 3D game where player starts in random position and needs to find exit in randomly generated (Depth-first search and recursive division algorithms) perfect maze. 
It's implemented using SDL2 and SDL2_image.
